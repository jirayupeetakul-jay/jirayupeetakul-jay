I am Jirayu Peetakul, Jay, originally from Thailand.
I am Ph.D. student in applied informatics at Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan, and will graduate in March 2022. Throughout my academic career, I worked as a software and hardware developer, primarily in C/C++, Rust, Python, MATLAB, and Verilog/VHDL. I created a series of algorithms, including data compression algorithms for vector, matrix, and tensor data, as well as low-level program development on SoC/microcontroller and FPGA. 

My most recent experience has already been in compressed sensing and sparse optimization, with the goal of developing faster data acquisition method and accelerating convex optimization using OpenCL and FPGA.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
