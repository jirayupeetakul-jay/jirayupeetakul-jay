I am a Ph.D. student in applied informatics at Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan, and will graduate in March 2022. I describe my experience as a software and hardware programmer throughout my academic career. I developed a dozen algorithms such as low-latency data compression algorithms, image/video coding algorithms, and low-level program development for SoC/microcontroller and FPGA. Furthermore, my most recent expertise is in compressed sensing and sparse optimization, aiming for a faster edge AI data acquisition model and centralized recovery.
