I am a Ph.D. student in applied informatics at Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan, and will graduate in March 2022. I describe my experience as a software and hardware programmer throughout my academic career. I developed a dozen algorithms such as low-latency data compression algorithms, image/video coding algorithms, and low-level program development for SoC/microcontroller and FPGA. My most recent experience is in compressed sensing and sparse optimization, with the goal of developing a faster edge AI data acquisition device and model with centralized processing center. I also developed a compression algorithm for an array sensor and imager based on compressed sensing. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
