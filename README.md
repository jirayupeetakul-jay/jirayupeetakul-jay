**If you are looking for software and hardware engineer, here I am!.**

I am Jirayu Peetakul, Jay, originally from Thailand.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in applied informatics at Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan, and will graduate in March 2022. 
I describe my experience as software and hardware programmer throughout my career, which mainly used C/C++, Rust, Python, MATLAB, R, Verilog/VHDL/HLS. 
I developed a dozen algorithms such as low-latency data compression algorithms, image/video coding algorithms, and low-level program development for SoC/microcontroller and FPGA. 
My most recent experience is in digital signal processing, compressed sensing, and sparse optimization to develop a faster edge AI data acquisition device and model with a centralized processing center.
I also developed a compression algorithm for an array sensor and imager based on compressed sensing theory.

I am a quick learner of programming languages and can quickly adapt to new ones.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
