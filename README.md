If you are looking for software and hardware engineer, here I am!.

I am Jirayu Peetakul, Jay, originally from Thailand.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in applied informatics at Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan, and will graduate in March 2022. 
I describe my experience as software and hardware engineer throughout my career, which mainly using
**C/C++, Rust, Python, MATLAB, R, Verilog/VHDL/HLS**.
I developed a dozen algorithms such as 
**low-latency data compression algorithms, image/video coding algorithms, and low-level program development for SoC/microcontroller and FPGA**. 
My most recent experience is in 
**digital signal processing, image processing, compressed sensing, sparse optimization, and matrix factorization**, 
with the goal of developing a faster edge AI data acquisition device and model with centralized processing center. 
I also developed a compression algorithm for an array sensor and imager based on compressed sensing. 

I am a quick learner of programming languages and can quickly adapt to new ones.
Hiring me is well worth the investment. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
